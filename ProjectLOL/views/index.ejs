            <p class="text-justify">Nowadays everything is standardized to reduce costs and programmed to be obsolete. The biggest social problems that come with this problem are labor exploitation and economic inequality. While companies profit, many workers and small-scale producers struggle to meet basic needs this way exacerbating global inequalities and limiting access to resources and opportunities for marginalized groups.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">We aim to raise awareness and inspire more thoughtful consumption behaviors. It's only by questioning and redefining our consumption habits and patterns that we can hope to build and go towards a more sustainable future for all. We think that our generation finds ourselves in the middle of this problem, we were born already in a consumerist society but also we are paying the environmental consequences of this unethical lifestyle.</p>

                <li><strong>Choose sustainable products:</strong> Opt for goods made from environmentally friendly materials, such as organic, recycled, or biodegradable options.</li>
                <li><strong>Support local and ethical brands:</strong> Buy from businesses that treat workers fairly and reduce your carbon footprint.</li>
                <li><strong>Buy less, buy better:</strong> Focus on quality over quantity.</li>
                <li><strong>Educate yourself and others:</strong> Share knowledge and encourage critical thinking about the impact of purchasing decisions.</li>
